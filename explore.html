                and do. You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet

                you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday
                between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts. During the school
                holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
                Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join,
